# 1. Is Mr. Nde Kum eligible for a loan based on his annual income?
is_eligible_for_loan = annual_income >= loan_amount

# 2. How much will Mr. Nde Kum pay in interest for the loan over the full term?
total_interest = loan_amount * interest_rate * loan_term_years

# 3. Can Mr. Nde Kum afford the monthly loan payment based on his monthly expenses?
monthly_loan_payment = (loan_amount + total_interest) / loan_term_months
can_afford_monthly_payment = account_balance >= monthly_loan_payment

# 4. Will Mr. Nde Kum still be eligible for the perk after making the withdrawal?
will_maintain_perk = (account_balance - withdrawal_amount) >= minimum_balance_for_perk

# 5. How much balance will remain in his account after the withdrawal?
remaining_balance_after_withdrawal = account_balance - withdrawal_amount

# 6. Has Mr. Nde Kum been with the bank for more than 5 years?
is_long_term_client = account_age_years > 5

# 7. What is the total amount Mr. Nde Kum will owe after 5 years, including interest?

# 8. Can Mr. Nde Kum withdraw the 4,000,000 CFA and still meet the conditions for the perk?
can_withdraw_and_maintain_perk = (account_balance - withdrawal_amount) >= minimum_balance_for_perk

# 9. Is the loan amount greater than 10 times Mr. Nde Kumâ€™s annual income?
is_loan_too_large = loan_amount > (10 * annual_income)

# 10. Is the transaction flagged as both "large" and "international" for further review?
